<h1>The Best Movies According to Matthew</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Sandlot</h3>
<p>This a classic film that brings me back to my youth. It is a testament to the era of wholesome comedies that existed in the 90s.</p>
<h3>Inception</h3>
<p>Conceptually, this is one of my favorite films because it combines fascinating sci-fi technology with the way our dreams work and the repressed attachments that they hide.</p>
<h3>Avengers:Infinity War</h3>
<p> This movie was a testament to modern day film production and the advancement of graphical capabilities. Not only was it visual stunning,
    it was also one of the first films of its kind that emphasized the failure of its protagonists in a very unsuspecting manner.</p>
